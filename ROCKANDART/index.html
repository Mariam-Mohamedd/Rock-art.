            <a href="https://www.rockandart.org/lgsm-lesbians-gays-and-miners-in-the-1980s/"><p>In the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the 1980s, for this community to unite with and gather support from miners seemed unlikely. The image of miners as brutal, conservative, and rough felt like an impossible partner for the queer cause. However, this was not the case for the LGSM movement in 1984.</p></a>

            <a href="https://www.rockandart.org/judith-butler-and-the-deconstruction-of-gender/"><p>What image comes to mind when we verbalise the concept of gender? Judith Butler (2007) destroys, in her famous work “Gender in Dispute”, the argument that delegitimises dissidence and minorities; referring to sexual practices and constructed identities.  Is the dissolution of binaries so monstrous and terrible? Is it impossible to contemplate?</p></a>

            <a href="https://www.rockandart.org/female-filmmakers-importance-history-women-film/"><p>As female filmmakers continue to be disregarded in events like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, it almost seems as though they are their own genre. However, this should not be the case. If we are on the pathway to equality, female filmmakers should not be a spectacle of bravery. French director Celine Sciamma, like many female directors, too often is asked the question: “What is it like being a woman in filmmaking?”.</p></a>

Dropping the name of a well-known killer in a news headline is a sure-fire way to generate clicks. In a study by Wiest (2019), it was found that many news articles include the names of serial killers irrelevant to the murders being reported. This is either as a means of comparison or simply for their notoriety.</p>

No matter what part, nook, or corner of the world one is from, women have always been fighting for what they deserve.  With the passing of the centuries, women who have belonged to different groups, castes, and societies have become more conscious of the misogyny that is all-encompassing and became aware of the change that needed to occur.

                <p>Sitting on the overground this morning I came across a warning ad of cyber sexual harassment or in more commonly known terms, unsolicited dick pics. It reminded readers that it’s a crime and will not be tolerated. However, what one can do after receiving such an image (apart from involving the police) was left unsaid. </p>

You have no idea what day it is or what you’re supposed to be doing with your life but one thing is for sure; it’s never too early for an alcoholic drink and there’s no such thing as too much food.  All your bad habits are out in full swing because you might as well wait until the New Year to sort your life out (again). </p>

After dropping the single ‘Easy on Me’ on 15th October, her long awaited comeback is well and truly underway, with her song soaring to number 1 almost straight away across the music charts. The song comes from a highly anticipated album titled ‘30’ which has promised to be the most emotional yet; Adele has hinted that it will address her inner turmoil and vulnerability after going through several big life changes since </p>
